Ontology Explorer

## Description
Ontology Explorer is a Python-based command-line tool designed to interact with the Ontology Lookup Service API provided by EBI. The tool fetches detailed information about a specified ontology based on its ID and displays it in either human-readable or machine-readable format.

### Usage

In the command line, go to the directory of the file.
Run the script from the command line using the following format:
  python ontology.py <ontology_id> <output_format>

<ontology_id>: The ID of the ontology you want to fetch information about (e.g., efo).
<output_format>: Specify the output format as 'human' for human-readable or 'machine' for machine-readable.
